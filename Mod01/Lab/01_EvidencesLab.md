```
az webapp list --resource-group ManagedPlatform --output table
```
![](Evidences/Image13.png)


Enter the following command to deploy the web.zip file to the web app that you created earlier in this lab:
```
az webapp deployment source config-zip --resource-group ManagedPlatform --src web.zip --name imgwebadrian
```
![](Evidences/Image14.png)


Observe the list of images in the gallery. The gallery should list a single image that was uploaded to Storage earlier in the lab.
![](Evidences/Image16.png)


Observe that the list of gallery images has updated with your new image.
