# Microsoft Az-204 (AdriÃ¡n Arenilla Seco)

## Lab 06: Authenticating to and querying Microsoft Graph by using MSAL and .NET SDKs
In this lab we will learn how to create a new application registry in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), use the MSAL.NET library to implement the interactive authentication flow, obtain a token from the Microsoft identity platform using the MSAL.NET library and query the Microsoft Graph using the Microsoft Graph SDK and the device code flow.
