## Microsoft Labs AZ-204 - Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure

In this module we will learn to create comprehensive solutions in Microsoft Azure.  
Deploy Azure compute solutions, create Azure roles, deploy and manage web applications, develop solutions that use Azure storage, implement authentication and authorization, and secure your solutions using KeyVault and Managed Identities.  
You will also learn how to connect and consume Azure services and third-party services, and include event- and message-based models in your solutions.  
It also covers monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimizing Azure solutions.
